# The Toolbox

## Description
This proposal outlines the design and development plan for a new website.

The toolbox is a website that is made to help users with their needs using the online tools available in the website. 

JS will be used in the home, about me, and the tool menu pages so that users can interact with buttons and images so that they can navigate through the website. We will also use JS on the actual tools, where a lot of math will be involved as we will be having cryptocurrency (as well as in-game currencies) converters and calculators. We also have different tools that can help improve your gameplay (when playing games), and other tools of convenience, such as the shop.

## Outline and features
The website will include the following pages and features:
- A home page introducing the website and to have a main hub for navigation around the website
- An About Us page to introduce the business/company
- A Tool Menu page listing all tools available in an organized manner for easy access. The tools available for this version will be a cryptocurrency converter, a calculator set (regular calculators, grade calculators, etc.), a tutorial section, and a shop section.
